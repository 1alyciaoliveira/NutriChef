# NutriChef
Are you tired of staring into your fridge or pantry, wondering what on earth to do with the random ingredients you've got lying around? Fear not! Our web app brings you amazing recipes with all the macronutrient information you need to make informed choices about what you eat. So you can enjoy a tasty meal while staying on track with your health goals.

This project was brought to life through an amazing partnership between two talented full-stack developers - Alycia Oliveira and Andrea Ceron. We used HTML, CSS, Bulma, and Javascript to create an app that's as functional as it is beautiful.
